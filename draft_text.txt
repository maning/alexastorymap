The mutiplication of loaves and fishes

Jesus was followed by a large crowd when
they saw him healing the sick.

He asked his disciples were they can buy enough 
food for the people.

Andrew came and said this boy have 5 loaves of bread 
and 2 fishes. Philip shouted "THAT IS NOT
ENOUGH!" 

Jesus took the loaves of bread and fishes. 
He gave thanks. Then, he broke it and
asked his disciples to distribute them to the poeple.

Once every one is full, he asked them to gather the leftovers
so nothing will be wasted. They collected 12 wicker
baskets filled with bread and fish. They were very surprised.
